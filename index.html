              <p><h1><i>Introduction</i></h1><!--everything with the <b> bolds the text, everything with the tag <u> underlines the elements, and everything with <i> itallicizes the elements-->
      
              <p><b><u>Birth Place and date:</u></b>
              <br><p style="text-indent: 40px">I was born in Chicago, United States on July 11, 2001.
              <p><b><u>Family:</u></b>
              <br><p style="text-indent: 40px">The family currently living in the US consists of me, my mom, and my brother. The rest are living in Taiwan and Korea.
              <p><b><u>How I got my name + Family name:</u></b>
              <br><p style="text-indent: 40px">To bring about how I got my name, I'm going to start off with talking about my dad's name. His name was Kwon Jae Young, and he basically went to Korean elementary school. When he grew up, he went to college and worked  in Japan and China. In those 2 countries, they use Chinese characters, so using sino-korean he went by "Quan ZaiYong", so that's why we decided to go by Quan. By now, he spoke a bunch of different languages including Japanese, English, Korean, and Chinese. When he met my mom he was in America doing some stuff, and since they both spoke Chinese they just put down my name as "Quan Xihong". "Xihong" though was also Sino-Korean so you can write that as 석홍, and my brother's name "Quan Xiyong" can be written as Kwon Seok Young. When I went to school, they'd always mess up my name since Americans can't pronounce "Xihong" so I just tell them to go by Jeff. I'm not sure how "Jeff" came to be, but it just did.

              <p>My mom is from Taiwan, and my dad is Korean so that makes me Korean-Taiwanese. But I'm American though since I was born here.

              <p><h1><i>Early Years</i></h1>
              <p><b><u>School/education:</u></b>
              <p><p style="text-indent: 40px">Shortly after I was born, we moved back to Japan since my dad was working there. We lived there for a couple months then moved to Taiwan. In Taiwan that's where I went to daycare and kindergarten. After living there for 3-4 years we moved back to America and that's where I went to school. From grades k-8 I went to a school called Mark Sheridan Academy, and for highschool I go to Whitney Young.

              <p><h1><i>Future Plans+What I want to do</i></h1>
              <p>My college goals are <a href="https://www.uchicago.edu" target="_blank" title="Uchicago">UChicago</a> and <a href="http://www.sesp.northwestern.edu/ugrad/wildcat-welcome/peer-advisers.html" target="_blank" title="northwestern">Northwestern</a>, and if possible I want to do study abroad. I want to major in something around the areas of engineering, or computer science.<!--the tags here sets a hyperlink to the colleges website. I also titled them so that when you hover over the text it shows you what it's about-->
              <p><ul>
                   <li> Volleyball
                   <li> Listening/playing music
                   <li> Learning new life skills
                   <li> Eat 
                   <li> Sleep
                 </ul>
             <p>As for goals, my goal in junior year is to just get a good act or sat score and focus on getting good grades so that I can get into the college that I want to go to. I hope that I can remain emotionally calm while doing so, and that I wouldn't stress out too much over small things.
